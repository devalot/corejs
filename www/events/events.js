// In the index.html file there are several elements containing the
// text "Click Me".  Those elements are followed by another element
// containing the number zero, which we'll call the "counter".
//
// Inside the anonymous function below, write the necessary code so
// that clicking any "Click Me" element will increment its paired
// counter.
//
// BONUS 1: Create a new element on the page that displays the sum of
// all other counters.
//
// BONUS 2: When the global counter goes above 10 add the "goal" class
// to it.  Doing so should make it turn red.

  // Your code here.
