 * Using only the built-in DOM methods, find the elements that have

 * div with id of #bucket.
 *
 * Hint: you can use:
 *
 *   - document.getElementById
 *   - document.getElementsByTagName
 *   - document.getElementsByClassName
 *   - document.querySelector
 *   - document.querySlectorAll
 *
 * and all the parent, child and sibling selectors, along with the DOM
 * traversal properties such as:
 *
 *   - parentNode
 *   - previousSibling
 *   - nextSibling
 *   - firstChild
 *   - lastChild
 *   - childNodes
 *
 * Make sure to read the index.html file and study the locations of
 * the FLAG elements.
